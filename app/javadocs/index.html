<br>
<p>These are the MVRT JavaDocs. The code uses the FRC Java Library
  to carry out tasks and control our robot. The main sections of
  code are commands and subsystems. Subsystems control a specific
  part of the robot (claw), while commands tell the subsytem to
  do something (open).
  <br>
  The code is run through the driver station to the robot.
