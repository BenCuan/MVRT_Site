<!-- um... a lot has changed from the original website...so... -->

## Original Design by Students

The design of this website was put together by our very own members. <del>It was
created completely from scratch using Adobe Photoshop CS5. Each section of the
website was thought through before it was coded to make sure that every page
will have a clean, sleek look. We want to provide the best appealing experience
possible for our visitors wherever they may be from.</del> <ins>The new website
skipped the Photoshop design process due to time constraints.</ins>

## Coded from Scratch<ins>(kinda)</ins>

<del>Once the design was finished, it was then coded by the Documentation
division.</del> The website implements <del>x</del>HTML, CSS, <ins>and</ins>
Javascript<del>, and PHP</del> which all works together to bring the user a very
smooth experience, and a clean interface. The code was hand-typed from scratch
to ensure that there is no unnecessary code that could slow down the
website<ins>, and optimized through various build processes</ins>.
<del>All pages are typed to comply with xHTML 1.0 Strict Standard so that it will
display properly across all major browsers. Our website also complies with the
508 Standards so our website can be accessed by blind users.</del><ins>We will
soon implement ARIA attributes and roles to make more accessible for
others. As for standards, there isn't much need to comply…</ins>

## Helping Others

Our most prized possession when it comes to this website is the [resources
section](/resources/). It took many years and hours of our member's time to put
together this amazing collection of tips, strategies, and more. Now, it is
available to all the teams across the entire world. Our resources section is
recognized by <i class="first">FIRST</i> and teams have thanked us for offering
an extensive amount of training documents.

## Spreading the Message

We strongly believe in providing the best experience we can for users accessing
our website in hopes that by doing so it will help spread the message of <i
class="first">FIRST</i> to people around the world. Our website is literally the
face of MVRT on the internet and we want to appeal to as large of an audience as
we can. <del>We have reached over 30,000 people from nations all over the
world.</del><ins>(Does anyone have the latest analytics?)</ins>

## Keeping Members and Parents Informed

<del>We have a section just for members and parents to make it easy to keep our
members informed. Our team calendar contains times and dates for team meetings,
volunteering events, and competition days. We also have a members area that is
exclusively for members where we post important information related to build and
the design of the robot.</del><ins>Uh, we still have to work on that…</ins>

---


<del>One really neat aspect of our website is that it also has fun, hidden pages such
as the "robotics dictionary" and the jokes page, which allow members to express
and share their creativity.</del><ins>Like we said, it's still TODO. But you can
check out our [humans.txt](/humans.txt) file right now! Actually, that is also
still TODO.</ins>
