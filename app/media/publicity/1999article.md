The buzzer sounds and the light turns on; it's off to the races for Sparky.

Revving its engine, Sparky runs for the puck in the center of the ring and rolls
on top of it.

From the other side, Robo Bear makes a mad dash for the center, extending the
wooden arm in an attempt to knock off Sparky.

Unwilling to back down, Sparky tightens its hold on the puck and fights for
position.

In the meantime, seemingly oblivious to the battle in the center, Beach Bot II,
Sparky's teammate, is being loaded with "floppies"--stuffed pillows--by a human
player and before it moves to assist Sparky by pushing the puck toward their
zone.

The fourth combatant, Rambo, malfunctions and doesn't make it out of the corner
to join in the battle.

When the buzzer sounds again, Sparky and Beach Bot are victorious. Their victory
over Robo Bear and Rambo, the teams from Willow Glen and Granite Bay high
schools, moves them into the semifinals of the NASA Ames California Regional.

Sparky is a robot designed by the students of Monta Vista High School. The robot
is the school's entry into the FIRST--For Inspiration and Recognition of Science
and Technology--robot competition.

FIRST, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to generate an interest in
science and engineering among youth, holds an annual robotics competition. The
national competition will be held April 22, 23 and 24 at Epcot Center in
Orlando, Fla.

At regionals, held at Moffett Field Feb. 25, 26 and 27, Monta Vista placed
fourth with Hope Chapel Academy, its alliance team from Hermosa Beach. Sparky
also received the "Outstanding Defense Round Award."

In addition to performing well at regionals, the team of 44 students, received
an award from Cupertino Mayor Wally Dean on Feb. 16.

This was the first time NASA Ames had held a regional competition, said Christy
Budenbender, an event organizer.

Sparky "It worked out well," Budenbender says. "When some of the robots were
destroyed on impact, we called in our engineers onsite to help fix them. Then
they noticed other robots needed some help, and they went back and got more
engineers to come help. They were really instrumental in making sure that every
single robot that started the competition finished it."

Twenty-seven teams from the western region, including several from the Bay Area,
participated in the event. Regardless of how a school placed at the competition,
every school will be represented at nationals.

NASA Ames hosted because it's one of the leading organizations in the
development of artificial intelligence.

"It was exciting to see the looks on the students' faces when their robot beat
another team," Budenbender says. "It really brought them together and made them
united."

The western region has never had a regional competition before. Although NASA
Ames geared the event toward generating interest in the community, it gave
students the opportunity to work on the strategy in playing the game.

"It was fun, exciting and frustrating all at the same time," says senior Allan
Cheng, who controlled Sparky. "We didn't have that much time to practice. We
worked all the way up to the last day building and fixing the robot. Most of the
practice came at the NASA regional competition."

This year's team was working in the shadows of El Toro, last year's robot, said
senior Abby Lin, team spokesperson.

El Toro, was a landmark robot for Monta Vista because it was the first time the
school participated in the robotics competition, which began in 1992. For a
first-year entrant, El Toro placed in the middle of the approximately 300-team
field and took second place in the animation category during the national event.

"Last year we wanted to place in the top half," said senior Shirley Lai, the
founder and president of Monta Vista's robotics team. "But what we really wanted
was not to place last or second to last."

Lai learned about the competition last year when she was volunteering at the
Tech Museum. Another volunteer told her about the robot his school was building,
but Lai, believing it was a robot to benefit mankind, wasn't that interested.

Lai's interest in the robot was finally piqued when she discovered that it would
be used for game playing. Believing it would be fun to build a robot for that
purpose, Lai returned to Monta Vista with the intention of starting her own
team.

Student interest was generally high, but finding a team advisor proved to be
more difficult, Lai said. She didn't find an advisor until the eighth teacher
she asked.

The Monta Vista team makes adjustments to Sparky the day before the competition.
He joined the team last year because he liked engineering, and Monta Vista
didn't have any other programs with such practical hands-on application of
engineering, said senior Rajesh Nishtala, who operated Sparky's arm.

The team, which had six weeks to design and build a robot, is run like a
corporation. The students divided into four main groups--mechanical, electrical,
animation and administrative.

While the mechanical and electrical groups worked with three professional
engineers on the development of the robot, the administrative end raised the
funds--$10,000 through sponsorships and donations--necessary for entry fees and
materials.

"The emphasis was to get the kids to do the work and thinking," said Satya
Nishtala, an engineer with Sun Microsystems. "I was more of a support role so
they could bounce ideas off me and for me to make suggestions. I looked to see
if they got the things right because if they don't, it's going to blow up. It's
no fun if the engineers build the robot and the kids take it to Florida. It's
more fun for these guys to do the critical thinking and do the
implementation."

To maintain interest in the competition, the game the robots play is different
each year.

Last year, the robots played a basketball-like game in which there were three
posts of differing heights. If it placed a ball in the center post, the robot
received triple points. Different point values were assigned to the other two
posts.

Team members agreed this year's game was much more challenging to play and
design for.

Rather than playing as an individual, the robots worked in teams of two.
Together they had to pick up as many floppies as possible, raise them eight
feet high and gain an advantageous position by either moving the puck into
their section of the playing field or raising themselves two feet off the
ground.

"Last year we just needed to move a ball eight feet high and then drop it,"
said senior Sean Kim. "This year we needed to move the puck, pick up a floppy,
move the floppy and work in conjunction with another robot. We have to do a
lot more, but it's more fun."

Animation is the category in which the students create a computer- generated
sequence of their robot in action. This year's animation has a space theme,
and Sparky works in alliance with El Toro.

The team also submitted a video they created for the Chairman's Award. The
15-minute video is designed to show the interaction between the community and
the team in the creation of the robot.

"The real challenge was to find a way to show somebody who doesn't know
anything about robotics a little glimpse of what goes on," said senior Ted
Sander, the student who did the editing and mixing.
