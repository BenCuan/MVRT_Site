<p>
The operations division manages and writes all the awards
for the build season. We also develops the Chairman's submissions
for the season. We are in charge of all non-engineering aspects
of the team, so we manage our FLL teams, as well as various
other STEM Related Activities, such as demos, and writing grants.
