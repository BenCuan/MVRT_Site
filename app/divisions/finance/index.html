  The Finance Division provides the funds for the team. Throughout the year we
  apply for grants from various companies such as BAE Systems, Google, and IBM as
  our primary source of funding. We also obtain funding from donations,
  application fees, and fundraising such as SCRIP. We keep the team on a tight
  budget especially during build season. For regional competitions, we also apply
  for the Entrepreneurship Award that rewards teams that are well structured to be
  able to finance its operations.
