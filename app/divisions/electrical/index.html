<p>The Electrical Division is in charge of programming and wiring the robot.
Members take in the software design and sensor implementation on the robot to
make the “brains” of the robot. During the first weeks of the build season we
will begin to work on wiring and programming the swerve drive along with
learning how various sensors work. Later on, we will begin working on drive code
and finalizing the sensors we use. In the last weeks, we will finish wiring the
robot and programming the manipulators.</p>
