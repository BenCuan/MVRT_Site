These are detailed guides on how to work in electrical.
Marcus will be teaching these in the fall.

<br>

[Electrical Measurements]
[Electrical Measurements Worksheet]
: An overview of how to measure electricity and the science behind it plus some safety notes.

[Wiring][Wiring 1]
: A step-by-step pictorial tutorial teaching wire stripping, crimping, and soldering.

[Wiring][Wiring 2]
: A simple pictorial schematic of a robot's wiring.

[New Control System]
: An introduction to the new control system which includes: the cRIO, Driver's Sation (OI), Digital Sidecar, Power Distribution Board, Jaguar Speed Controller and Labview.

[Old Control System]
: A basic overview of what the old system was like and the main parts of the system.

[Driver Station]
: An in-depth view of how the driver station works.

[Robot Sensors]
: A thorough explaination of: if-else statements, state machines, different loops, and Vex sensors.

[Robot Code]
: An introduction into coding a robot to drive teleoperated and autonomous.

[LabVIEW I]
[Timeline for LabVIEW I Training]
: An introduction to robot projects and communication with the robot.

[LabVIEW II]
: An introduction to robot projects and communication with the robot.

[LabVIEW III]
: A walkthrought of the robot code and WIP library.

[LabVIEW IV]
: An introduction to reading power.

[Additional Programming Concepts]
: A tutorial on additional programming concepts including case structures, loops and clusters.
