<p>
The Documentation Division is responsible for documenting precious memories of
the team. We capture moments at competitions, events, and build with photos,
videos, and words. We also distribute information about outreach events to the
team. We are also responsible for updating the MVRT Blog and creating the team
newsletter that is distributed to members, parents, sponsors, and mentors. In
addition, we work closely with the Public Relations Division to create the
Chairmanâ€™s Video during build and the Media Division to create posters, flyers
and more.
