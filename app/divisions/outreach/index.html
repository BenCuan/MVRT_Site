According to Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST, FIRST wishes “to transform our culture
by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young
people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.” In order to follow
FIRST’s vision, all participating teams are encouraged to instill an
appreciation of the real-life rewards and career opportunities to others within
their supportive community.<br>
