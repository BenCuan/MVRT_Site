<p>The Mechanical Division is in charge of the design, fabrication, and assembly of
the robot. During the first couple of weeks of the build season we prototype the
different possible designs of the robot (prototypes are usually made out of
basic materials: wood, PVC, Aluminum Extrusion, etc.) and present them at design
reviews. Then, we finalize the designs, using Solidworks (our 3D CAD modeling
program), and make the final versions. At the end, we put it all together as one
mechanically complete robot.</p>
