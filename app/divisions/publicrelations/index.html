The Public Relations Division is the integral part of spreading engineering
throughout the community. We hold events throughout the Bay Area to reach out to
different groups and teach people about not only robotics but the fields of
science and technology. We uphold the ideals of FIRST by starting youth robotics
programs at local schools and helping businesses and programs internationally.
We work closely with other teams, divisions, and sponsors to best promote both
gracious professionalism and engineering to everyone.
