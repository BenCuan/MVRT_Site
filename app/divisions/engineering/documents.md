[Job Description]
: An overview of the job description for the mechanical build leads.

[Inventor Naming Conventions]
: In order to help keep track of all the inventor files our members create overtime, we use this document to help organize our files.

[Ordering Bosch]
: This document can be helpful for teams that use bosch as the framing material for their robot and need to know how to order bosch.

[Training Schedule]
: This training schedule has been used in the past to train rookies before build season begins. This schedule is used for our engineering, mechanical, and electrical divisions.

[Tool Manual]
: In order to have a successful build season, each team needs the right tools.  Composed within this document is a list of tools that we use throughout each build season.

[End of Kickoff]
: This powerpoint is what we use to recap what we will be doing during build with the rest of the team at the end of the first day of the build season.

[Design Review 1]
: We used this powerpoint to show our mentors and parents on our team our plans for the robot one week into build. At the start of the design review, we review the game video and rules. Then we continue with the designs we have prototyped and put onto Inventor and discuss the good and the bad.
