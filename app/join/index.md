There are five steps to become a member of MVRT. All five steps are mandatory
in order to join the team. The deadline for completing all parts is September

2. Pay the $135 membership donation (or $160 with a polo) with a check made out to
   MV ASB. Polos will have the MVRT logo on one side, and your name embroidered on
   the other side. If you have any personal financial issues with paying the membership
   fee, please talk to us! We are more than willing to accommodate to your situation
   and we donâ€™t want money to be a reason for your not joining.

   IMPORTANT: Because this is a donation to the team, MVRT requests that parents
   get matching donations from their companies, if possible. Click
