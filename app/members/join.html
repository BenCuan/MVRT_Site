    <p>Hi everyone!<br><br>

There are five parts you must complete to become a member of MVRT. All five parts are mandatory if you want to join the team. The deadline for completing all parts will be September 29, the day of our second team meeting.<br><br>

1.Fill out the online application available here.<br><br>

2.Pay the $135 membership fee (or $160 with a polo). Polos will have the MVRT logo on one side, and your name embroidered on the other side. If you have any personal financial issues with paying the membership fee, please do talk to us! We are more than willing to accommodate to your situation and we donâ€™t want money to be a reason for not joining.<br><br>

4.Print out, complete, and sign the MVRT Charter available here.<br><br>
