# Games

Every year the <i> FIRST </i>organization creates a new game which all teams
must build the robot to play. Listed below are links to the games of previous
years.

## Aerial Assist

The goal is to score points by getting the ball into the goals on the two ends of the field. There are two 11 feet wide "high" goals about 7 feet off the ground and about 3 feet tall and there are two "low" goals that are small boxes on each alliance's of the field. The high goals are worth more points than the low goals. The field also has a truss that is horizontal bar that is 5 feet off of the ground.

Each Alliance consists of three robots, and they compete to score as many discs into
their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen (15)-second match.
The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent by shooting balls into a goal, climbing an alliance tower, or lifting an alliance robot off the playing surface.

## Lunacy

 <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnGfbGzEFrM"> Watch the animation.</a>Lunacy is a game played on a field known as the Crater. Two alliances, one red and one blue, composed of three FIRST Robotics Competition teams each, compete in each match. The objective of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent by placing the game pieces in the trailers hitched to the opposing alliance's robots. 

## Overdrive

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYnUDaEi1D8"> Watch the animation.</a>Overdrive is played on a 27' x 54' carpeted field, where two alliances with three teams each move around the track moving track balls. The alliance players, which are composed of drivers, a coach, and a robocoach, are located at the end of the field from where they control their robots. The robocoach uses the four function Infrared Board to control the robot during Hybrid mode, giving a signal the initiate a series of commands for the robot to complete. Robocoaches are located at the corners of the track. The robots start against their alliance wall.
