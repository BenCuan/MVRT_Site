<p>Since 1997, MVRT has been the premier Engineering organization
on campus. We work to promote STEM at school, in the community, and
abroad. MVRT educates our students in Engineering, but also how to
run an organization, including outreach and finance. MVRT teaches our
members the skills necessary to succeed in STEM and other fields<p>
