On the mechanical side of MVRT, Nadia and Josephine fixed polycarb boxes to go around the gears. They also velcroed the motors onto the gears. Anand machined more grabber plate fingers and also cut the pulleys. Shantanu assembled the chain covers and the placement for roller arm motors. Nihil, Chirag and Aashish worked in CAD for drawings of the new parts. Chirag also worked on the elevator mountings. On the electrical side of MVRT, Akhil and his group finished the ultrasonic code. They continued working on OI and they also tested LED's and started setting up the Raspberry Pi. Marcus and his group learned a lesson on dynamically allocated memory, pointers, and memory structures. They also experienced problems with OpenCV involving the translation from the RGB colorspace to the HSV colorspace which causes problems with various filters.
