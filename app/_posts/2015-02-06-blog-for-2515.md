On the mechanical side of MVRT, Nadia and Josephine fixed polycarb boxes that go around the gears. They also velcroed on the motors to the gears. Anand machined more grabber plates finger and also cut the pulleys. Shantanu assembled the chain covers and the placement for roller arm motors. Nihil, Chirag and Aashish worked in CAD for drawings of the new parts. Chirac also worked not the elevator mountings. On the electrical side of MVRT, Akhil and his group finished the ultrasonic code. They continued working on OI and they also tested LEO's and started setting up the Raspberry Pier. Marcus and his group learned a lesson on dynamic allocated memory, pointers, and memory structures. They also experienced problems which could set them back such as the fact that the default color space of Open CV about how the input is BGR rather than HSV. They also made a draft version of final filtering algorithm.
