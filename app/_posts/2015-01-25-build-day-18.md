Both Mechanical and Electrical worked diligently today and made a lot of progress! On the mechanical side, Daniel and his group finished riveting the second chassis, and most mechanical work, such as adding motors, is finished for both of the chassis. Anand milled the blocks for the elevator. For electrical, Heather's group  worked on programming the rollers and arms. Michael, Chris, and their rookies spent time attaching the components to the chassis.
