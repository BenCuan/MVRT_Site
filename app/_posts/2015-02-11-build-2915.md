As the build season comes to an end, the team is making wonderful progress!

The mechanical team assembled the claw, and welded the carriage. Also the gusset plates for the diagonals were finished,
 and the diagonal structure was made.

Meanwhile, the electrical team scaled the encoders by using encoder ratios, etc. Most of previous days work was continued.
