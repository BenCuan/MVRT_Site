With only 5 days left of build, the team made some great progress!

In mechanical, Nihil fixed errors in the CAD, and assembled the Grabber.
 Meanwhile the diagonals were mounted, and Anand machined parts for the elevator.

In electrical, Chris marked the pneumatics on the robots, and continued to wire. 
Heather tested voltage (camping?), and Akhil edited previous code, tested precession dive, and wired ultrasonic sensors.
