On the electrical side of MVRT, Heather demoed the 2012 Rebound Rumble robot at Faria Elementary School for our ThinkFIRST session there. She also got the beta equipment ready to be sent back. Marcus and his team were settling in filters via color. On the mechanical side of MVRT, Anand machined parts necessary for the robot, and Josephine worked on cading parts. Daniel, Nihil, and Chirag almost finished assembling the chasis.
