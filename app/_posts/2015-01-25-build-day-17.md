On the electrical side, Shovik and Ahkil looked into different layouts of the driver station, as well as all the functions necessary for proper operation of the robot. Marcus and his team continued improving the robot's artificial vision, looking at different types of filters and researching how to sharpen the color of the camera's input. Lastly, Chris and his group crimped the Talon SRX's with CAN wires.
On the mechanical side of MVRT, Daniel took measurements for the bin to be extracted at the "step".Aashish and his group tested different ways of bonding polycord. Anand finished milling the front and back 2X1 and worked on the robot on CAD.
