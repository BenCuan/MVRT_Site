MVRT worked on extending the progress made from last week. On the electrical side, Michael and his group of rookies wired in talons, and got PWMs working in CAD. Build Lead Marcus tested various narrow edge detection filters and Gaussian passes. His team also worked on several algorithms. Akhil and Shovik's crew continued working on range detection. Overall Electrical worked on debugging problems they faced.

On the mechanical side, Aashish and Chirag fixed the intake roller, and started making poly-cord loops for intaking. Josephine finished making pieces for the roller. Daniel and his team improved on rollers and fixed all the problems the roller was giving them. Now totes can go in any side, lengthwise or width wise without any problems. Anand finished the side rails for the chassis. Nihil worked on CAD for the grabbers.
