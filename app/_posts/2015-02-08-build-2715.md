As competitions draw closer, the robot is heading near completion. The mechanical team finished assembling the first chassis, and finished most of the test chassis. Parts for the elevator system are being manufactured, and the claw has been made.

Electrical continued to polish up their code for final testing during the next week, and prepared to wire the robot, which will take place tomorrow. Marcus and Lee continued to work on debugging vision, and we also developed a revision for the Talon breakout board with different resistor values. Electrical also had a rad dance party.

Overall, the robot is starting to take shape.
