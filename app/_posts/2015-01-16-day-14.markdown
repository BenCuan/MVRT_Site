Both mechanical and electrical have made great strides in our second prototyping phase. The auxilary group continued experimenting with USB camera, accelerometer, and gyroscpe (as part of the navX MXP). Our error is reduced to 4Â°/100s, which seems to correspond to the rotation of the Earth. The error changed axes when the board was rotated. The coding group began work on the elevator actuator code. We also recieved a multi double solenoid manifold which we tested with six pneumatic actuators.
In the workshop, groups continued milling the ABS parts in the second prototype for the grabber. The roller system, in the words of Aashich, was improved from "good to awesome."
