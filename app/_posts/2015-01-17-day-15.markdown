The prototyping groups continued their work from yesterday. Chirag and Daniel continued to test the intake mechanism and continued to face problems. When the totes were loaded lengthwise, the chain touched the totes. In order to prevent this interaction, they increased the radius of the rollers. However, the same problem arose when the group inserted the tote widthwise. The 2x1s for the side of our drive were machined today. Another group worked to machine the ABS for the final roller intakes. Today, we also confirmed and finalized the CAD of the grabber mechanism.
On the electrical side, reading from the webcam in OpenCV was finalized in C++, and worked continued on the autonomous stage of the game. We also recieved the new <a href="http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-3060.htm">navX MXP Navigation Sensor</a>, which is far more accurate than the old analog gyros. The coding group finalized the drive base and began work on acceleration limits and gyro-driven drive straight.
