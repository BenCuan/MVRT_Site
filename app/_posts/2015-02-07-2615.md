With 11 days left of build, mechanical finished a lot of work today. They attached the elevator shafts, and drilled holes for the elevator mount into the chassis. The pem nuts have also been added to the chassis. The mechanical team still needs to complete the CAD work for the gusset plates.

Meanwhile, the electrical team continued to work on vision code, and converting algorithms to code. They continued to work on the roller control code, code for the OI, elevator control (such as up/down functions), and also reviewed previous code.

At the end of the day both the mechanical and electrical teams finished much work, but there still is much to do before the robot is complete.
