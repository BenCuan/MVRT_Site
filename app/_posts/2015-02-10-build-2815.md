Both electrical and mechanical have made a great progress today!

Starting with the mechanical side, Daniel and his team finished making the elevators and carriages.
Meanwhile Josephine finished making parts for the grabber. The poly-carb boxes around the gears are 
also nearing completion.

Moving on to electrical, Michael and Chris wired both chassis. Marcus debugged the UPD code in both 
C++ and Java. He also worked on code for the camera. Akhil and Shovik meanwhile fixed and reviewed old code.
