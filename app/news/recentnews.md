## STEAMFEST Demo

MVRT attended the STEAMFEST demo, to connect with the community.
We demonstrated the Recycle-Rush robot to various adults and children.
This was a great way to give back to the community that has given so
much to us.

## Google Demo

MVRT recently attended a demo at the Google Campus, seeking
to show our sponsors what we have been able to accomplish.
The club interested many Googlers and gave the team a unique
experience. We were able to spread FIRST throughout the Googlers,
and had a great time. Photos coming soon.
